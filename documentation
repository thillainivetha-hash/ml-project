ML-Project  Documentation

Stage 1: Basic Setup (Foundation)

1. Create and navigate into a new directory
   mkdir ml-project          # make a directory called ml-project
   cd ml-project             # change into that directory
2.Initialize a Git repository
   git init                  # create a new .git folder, starting version control
3. Create the four project files
   touch train.py predict.py utils.py README.md
   These commands generate empty placeholders for each file required by the project.
4. Inspect repository status
   git status                # lists untracked files and repo state

 Stage 2: Version Control Workflow (Application)
After editing `train.py` and `utils.py`, the following commands are run to record and push my work.

1. Stage the modified files
   git add train.py utils.py
   Only the two changed files are added to the index; other files remain untracked.

2. Create a commit with a message
   git commit -m "Add training script and utilities"
   
   This snapshots the staged changes locally with the given note

3. Create the remote repository

1.	Go to GitHub,
2.	 click New repository,
3.	 name it `ml-project`,
4.	 and create it.

4. Link the local repo to GitHub
   git remote add origin https://github.com/thillainivetha-hash/ml-project.git
 5. Push the commit to GitHub
   git push -u origin master
   Uploads the `master` branch and sets `origin/master` as the upstream for future pushes.

Stage 3: Mini-Project - Collaborative Workflow (Synthesis)
 Current scenario
1. Remote has updated `predict.py` and `README.md`.
2. Local  has modified `utils.py` and added a new `config.py` (not yet committed).

 Workflow guide

1. Synchronize with remote first
   git pull origin main
   This fetches changes from GitHub and merges them into my local branch. Always pull before committing our own work to avoid falling behind.

2. Review changes
   git status
   git diff
   Run `git status` to check current modifications and untracked files; `git diff` shows what we have changed.

3. Stage our local edits and new file
   git add utils.py config.py
   
4.Commit locally with a clear message
   git commit -m "commiting new changes after my teammate"
   Good commit messages help my teammates understand my  changes.

5. Push to the remote repository
   git push origin main
   Sends my new commits to GitHub so others can access them.

Potential issues & best practices

- Merge conflicts: If me and my teammate edit the same lines, `git pull` will pause and flag conflicts. Have to resolve them manually, then `git add` and `git commit` to complete.
- Out-of-date branch: Pulling regularly reduces the chance of non-fast-forward errors during `git push`.
- Untracked files: Have remember to add new files or they won’t be included in commits/pushes.
- Using feature branches for larger work. Each team /team members  can have a separate branch
